        <img src="images/university.jpg" alt="University Campus">
        <p>Hello, my name is Emil Medarov.I was born on February, 25th, 2001 in Kardzhali, Bulgaria.<br>
        I finished my secondary education at the "Hristo Botev" Language High School, Kardzhali(2015-2020).<br>
        I'm currently studying at Plovdiv University "Paisii Hilendarski", majoring in Informatics.<br>
        I'm currently a fourth year student.I'm from the class of 2020.<br>
        Deciding whether to go to university was a big decision in my life.<br>
        After high school, I was faced with the choice of continuing my education or exploring other paths.<br>
        Here's how I ultimately made the decision to pursue a university degree:</p>
        <h2>Exploring My Interests</h2>
        <p>I began by considering my interests and passions.<br>
        I made a list of subjects and fields that excited me.<br>
        I realized that many of these subjects were taught at the university level.<br>
        I knew that pursuing a degree in a field I was passionate about would lead to a more fulfilling educational experience.</p>
        <h2>Long-Term Goals</h2>
        <p>I also thought about my long-term goals.<br>
        I envisioned the career I wanted to have and the impact I wanted to make in the world.<br>
        Many of the roles I aspired to required a higher education.<br>
        I recognized that a university degree could provide me with the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve those goals.</p>
        <h2>Personal Growth and Development</h2>
        <p>University represented an opportunity for personal growth and development.<br>
        I wanted to challenge myself academically and gain a deeper understanding of various subjects.<br>
        Additionally, the university environment seemed like a place where I could meet diverse people,<br>
        engage in meaningful discussions, and broaden my horizons.</p>
        <h2>Researching Universities</h2>
        <p>I spent time researching different universities and their programs.<br>
        I looked into their faculty, facilities, and extracurricular activities.<br>
        Finding a university that aligned with my interests and values was important to me.<br>
        I attended university fairs and open houses to get a feel for the campuses and their communities.</p>
        <h2>Financial Considerations</h2>
        <p>While pursuing higher education was appealing, I also considered the financial aspects.<br>
        I researched scholarships, grants, and student loans to understand the financial aid options available.<br>
        Planning for the costs associated with university education helped me make an informed decision.</p>
        <h2>Final Decision</h2>
        <p>After careful consideration of my interests, goals, personal growth, university options, and financial<br>
        factors, I decided that pursuing a university education was the right path for me.<br>
        I felt excited about the opportunities that lay ahead and was prepared to embark on this new chapter of my life.</p>
